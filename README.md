# Instacart Market Basket Analysis

This repo shows a set of Jupyter Notebooks that I used to tackle the Instacart Masket Basket Analysis challenge. The [dataset](https://github.com/Kannupriya1999/Instacart-Basket-Analysis/tree/main/data) for this competition is a relational set of files describing customers' orders over time. The goal of the competition is to predict which products will be in a user's next order. The dataset is anonymized and contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. For each user, Instacart provides between 4 and 100 of their orders, with the sequence of products purchased in each order. Instacart also provides the week and hour of day the order was placed, and a relative measure of time between orders.

Here are the different notebooks:
* [Data Exploration](https://github.com/Kannupriya1999/Instacart-Basket-Analysis/blob/main/notebooks/Instacart-Simple-Data-Exploration.ipynb): Exploring the raw datasets.
* [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/Kannupriya1999/Instacart-Basket-Analysis/blob/main/notebooks/Customer-Segments-with-PCA.ipynb): Segmenting the customers with Principal Component Analysis and K-Means Clustering.
* [Association Rule Mining](https://github.com/Kannupriya1999/Instacart-Basket-Analysis/blob/main/notebooks/Association-Rule-Mining.ipynb): Applying the Apriori algorithm to mine association rules between orders and customers.
